  Welcome to EngineeringPaper.xyz! By using this software, you are agreeing to
  the following terms and conditions.
</p>

<br />

<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>
  EngineeringPaper.xyz strives to protect user privacy. This is free and open
  source software that does not require you to create an account to use. All of
  the calculations you perform on EngineeringPaper.xyz are performed on your own
  computer and nothing you enter into your sheets is sent to our servers unless
  you create a shareable link or export your sheet as a Microsoft Word .docx file
  or a PDF file. When you create a shareable link, we only store the minimum amount of information 
  required to run the shareable link service (see details below). When you export 
  your sheet as a .docx or a .pdf file, no information is retained on the EngineeringPaper.xyz 
  servers (see details below). Using your browser's print functionality to save your sheet
  as a PDF file sends no data to the EngineeringPaper.xyz servers.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  You have the option to save your full sheets to your local drive as .epxyz files. If you only save
  your sheets locally as .epxyz or Markdown files, none of your data is ever sent to our servers.
</p>
<br />
<h4>No Warranty and Limitation of Liability</h4>
<p>
  THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND THE AUTHOR DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES WITH
  REGARD TO THIS SOFTWARE INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY
  AND FITNESS. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, DIRECT,
  INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER RESULTING FROM
  LOSS OF USE, DATA OR PROFITS, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE OR
  OTHER TORTIOUS ACTION, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OR
  PERFORMANCE OF THIS SOFTWARE.
</p>
<br />
<h4>Privacy</h4>
<p>
  EngineeringPaper.xyz does not use cookies and does not track its users. The
  only time personal information is collected is when you use the "Get Shareable
  Link" feature of this site. When creating a shareable link, your IP address is
  stored in a database along with the contents of the sheet that is uploaded.
  The reason we collect the IP address for uploaded sheets is to protect this
  free shareable link service from abuse. When creating a shareable link, your
  data is stored on Cloudflare's global network. Cloudflare automatically
  attempts to locate data closest to the user to improve overall performance.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  For technical reasons, it is necessary to send data to the EngineeringPaper.xyz 
  servers to convert your sheets to .docx or .pdf files. No data is retained 
  on the EngineeringPaper.xyz servers when creating .docx or .pdf files. 
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Saving your sheets locally as .epxyz or Markdown files avoids sending any of your data to our database. 
  Additionally, sheets can be convert to a PDF file using the browser's print functionality
  without sending any data to the EngineeringPaper.xyz servers.
</p>
<br />
<h4>No Data Retention Guarantee for Shareable Links</h4>
<p>
  Our goal is to store sheets using the shareable link feature for the life of
  the shareable link service. However, we provide no guarantee to the
  accessibility of shareable links in the future. We reserve the right to shut
  down the shareable link service at any time, and for any reason, without
  warning. We also reserve the right to delete any uploaded sheet at any time,
  and for any reason, without warning.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  To ensure future access to your sheets, be sure to save them locally as .epxyz files
  (even if you have created a shareable link).
